## üåü Overview

**Tic Tac Toe Bolt** is not your traditional Tic Tac Toe game! This innovative Flutter application adds a lightning-fast, dynamic twist to the classic game we all know and love. With sleek animations, a modern UI, and a unique gameplay mechanic where your oldest moves disappear, it creates a faster-paced, more strategic gaming experience.

## ‚ö° Game Mechanics

Tic Tac Toe Bolt introduces a revolutionary twist to the classic game:

- **Limited Active Moves**: Each player can only have their last **three** moves active on the board at any time
- **Disappearing Moves**: When you make your fourth move, your first move disappears from the board
- **Dynamic Strategy**: As the board constantly changes, players must continuously adapt their strategy
- **Classic Winning Condition**: Still get three in a row to win, but with your currently active pieces

<div align="center">

| Traditional Tic Tac Toe | Tic Tac Toe Bolt |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Static board | Dynamic board |
| All moves remain | Only last 3 moves per player remain |
| Predictable strategies | Constantly evolving gameplay |
| Can end in frequent draws | Reduces chance of draws |
| 9 total possible moves | Potentially unlimited moves |
| Single strategy path | Multiple strategic approaches |

## üé≤ Game Logic

### State Management

The game's state is managed within the `_GameScreenState` class, which tracks:

1. The current board configuration
2. Whose turn it is (X or O)
3. Move history for each player
4. Game outcome (winner or draw)

### Move Mechanics

<div align="center">

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Player Makes Move] --> B{Is Cell Empty?}
    B -->|No| A
    B -->|Yes| C[Place Symbol on Board]
    C --> D[Add to Player's Move List]
    D --> E{Does Player Have > 3 Moves?}
    E -->|No| F[Check for Win]
    E -->|Yes| G[Remove Oldest Move from Board]
    G --> F
    F --> H{Is There a Winner?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Declare Winner]
    H -->|No| J{Is Board Full?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Declare Draw]
    J -->|No| L[Switch Player Turn]
    L --> A
```

</div>

### Win Detection

The game checks for a win after each move by examining:

- All rows (horizontal)
- All columns (vertical)
- Both diagonals

A win occurs when a player has three of their symbols in any of these lines.

### Game State Statistics

<div align="center">

## üîç Code Analysis

### Main App Configuration

```dart
class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MainApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tic Tac Toe Bolt',
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.indigo,
        visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
        fontFamily: 'Poppins',
        brightness: Brightness.light,
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
          seedColor: Colors.indigo,
          brightness: Brightness.light,
          secondary: Colors.amber,
        ),
      ),
      darkTheme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.indigo,
        visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
        fontFamily: 'Poppins',
        brightness: Brightness.dark,
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
          seedColor: Colors.indigo,
          brightness: Brightness.dark,
          secondary: Colors.amber,
        ),
      ),
      themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
      home: const SplashScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

**Key Elements:**
- Uses MaterialApp as the root widget
- Configures both light and dark themes
- Sets 'Poppins' as the app's font
- Disables the debug banner
- Uses ColorScheme.fromSeed for consistent color generation
- Sets SplashScreen as the initial route

### Game Logic Analysis

The core game logic is encapsulated in these key methods:

#### Move Handling

```dart
void _handleCellTap(int row, int col) {
  // Ignore taps if the game is over or the cell is already filled
  if (winner != null || isDraw || board[row][col] != null) {
    return;
  }

  setState(() {
    // Current player's symbol
    String symbol = isPlayerXTurn ? 'X' : 'O';
    
    // Place the symbol on the board
    board[row][col] = symbol;
    
    // Track the move
    Position newMove = Position(row, col);
    if (isPlayerXTurn) {
      playerXMoves.add(newMove);
      // Remove oldest move if we have more than 3
      if (playerXMoves.length > 3) {
        Position oldestMove = playerXMoves.removeAt(0);
        board[oldestMove.row][oldestMove.col] = null;
      }
      
      // Trigger animation for the new move
      _cellControllers[row][col].reset();
      _cellControllers[row][col].forward();
    } else {
      playerOMoves.add(newMove);
      // Remove oldest move if we have more than 3
      if (playerOMoves.length > 3) {
        Position oldestMove = playerOMoves.removeAt(0);
        board[oldestMove.row][oldestMove.col] = null;
      }
      
      // Trigger animation for the new move
      _cellControllers[row][col].reset();
      _cellControllers[row][col].forward();
    }
    
    // Check for win
    if (_checkWin(symbol)) {
      winner = symbol;
      _winnerController.forward();
    } 
    // Check for draw - this is tricky in this variant, as the board keeps changing
    // We'll consider it a draw if all cells are filled and no winner
    else if (_isBoardFull()) {
      isDraw = true;
    }
    
    // Switch turns
    isPlayerXTurn = !isPlayerXTurn;
  });
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Guards against invalid moves
- Updates the board state
- Manages move history for each player
- Implements the "disappearing moves" mechanic
- Triggers appropriate animations
- Checks for win/draw conditions
- Switches player turns

#### Win Detection

```dart
bool _checkWin(String symbol) {
  // Check rows
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    if (board[i][0] == symbol && board[i][1] == symbol && board[i][2] == symbol) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  
  // Check columns
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    if (board[0][i] == symbol && board[1][i] == symbol && board[2][i] == symbol) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  
  // Check diagonals
  if (board[0][0] == symbol && board[1][1] == symbol && board[2][2] == symbol) {
    return true;
  }
  if (board[0][2] == symbol && board[1][1] == symbol && board[2][0] == symbol) {
    return true;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

**Logic:**
- Checks all three rows for a horizontal win
- Checks all three columns for a vertical win
- Checks both diagonals for a diagonal win
- Returns true if any win condition is met

### Custom Painters

The game uses custom painters to render X and O symbols:

#### X Painter

```dart
class XPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final Color color;
  
  XPainter(this.color);
  
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final paint = Paint()
      ..color = color
      ..strokeWidth = 8
      ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke;
    
    canvas.drawLine(
      Offset(size.width * 0.2, size.height * 0.2),
      Offset(size.width * 0.8, size.height * 0.8),
      paint,
    );
    
    canvas.drawLine(
      Offset(size.width * 0.8, size.height * 0.2),
      Offset(size.width * 0.2, size.height * 0.8),
      paint,
    );
  }
  
  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) => false;
}
```

#### O Painter

```dart
class OPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final Color color;
  
  OPainter(this.color);
  
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final paint = Paint()
      ..color = color
      ..strokeWidth = 8
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke;
    
    canvas.drawCircle(
      Offset(size.width / 2, size.height / 2),
      size.width * 0.35,
      paint,
    );
  }
  
  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) => false;
}
```

**Design Choices:**
- Uses stroke style for a clean, modern look
- Rounded stroke caps for X symbol
- Proportional sizing based on available space
- Customizable color for theming support

  AIPlayer({this.difficulty = AIDifficulty.medium});
  
  Position getNextMove(List<List<String?>> board, List<Position> aiMoves, List<Position> playerMoves) {
    switch (difficulty) {
      case AIDifficulty.easy:
        return _getRandomMove(board);
      case AIDifficulty.medium:
        return _getSmartMove(board, aiMoves, playerMoves, randomizationFactor: 0.4);
      case AIDifficulty.hard:
        return _getOptimalMove(board, aiMoves, playerMoves);
    }
  }
  
  Position _getRandomMove(List<List<String?>> board) {
    // Implementation for random valid move
  }
  
  Position _getSmartMove(List<List<String?>> board, List<Position> aiMoves, 
                        List<Position> playerMoves, {double randomizationFactor = 0.0}) {
    // Implementation for somewhat intelligent move with randomization
  }
  
  Position _getOptimalMove(List<List<String?>> board, List<Position> aiMoves, List<Position> playerMoves) {
    // Implementation using minimax algorithm
  }
}
```
